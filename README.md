# 10C-HW2
Playing with Qt Creator: Grade Calculator

This program is a GUI that allows a user to calculate their grade for PIC10C/PIC10B.
The GUI itself was designed in QtDesigner.

## Possible Improvements
1. Reload the form of the GUI depending on the class that is chosen.
2. Allow user to manually enter the percentage breakdown of assignments and exams.
3. Allow user to import/define their own class and grading scheme.
4. Clean up and minimize code base.
